# Given objective –
Develop a React Native screen that displays a layout as per the design with a QR code pointing to nexalink.co.
# Tools and Libraries used –
1. React Native, Javascript – to build the app’s interface.
2. React-native-vector-icon – a library that provides customizable vector icons for React Native applications.
3. React-native-qrcode-svg – for generating QR codes in React Native applications.
4. React-native-responsive-screen – creates flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
# Approach –
1. Setting Up React Native Project –
Created a new React native project using, “npx react-native init NexaLink”
2. Installing Dependencies –
I am installing the necessary dependencies mentioned above in the "Tools and Libraries" section, i.e., react-native-vector-icon, react-native-qrcode-svg, and react-native-responsive-screen.
3. Layout Implementation –
I used Flexbox and react-native-responsive-screen (widthPercentageToDP, heightPercentageToDP) to structure the components as per the design given.
4. Icons Integration-
Utilized a library, react-native-vector-icon, to integrate icons into the application.
5. QR Code Integration –
Utilized a library, react-native-qrcode-svg to generate a QR code pointing to “nexalink.co”.
6. Styling –
Apply styles to match the design assigned using inline and internal stylesheet.
7. Testing –
I used different devices and screen sizes to test the layout and responsiveness.
Thank you for the opportunity to complete the technical assignment and I am excited to work with NexaLink.
